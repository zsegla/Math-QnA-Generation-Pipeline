"A particle moves along a trajectory defined parametrically by x(t) = t and y(t) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4t^2} + \frac{1}{t}} for 0 < t  1.  The particle's instantaneous velocity vector is given by  \textbf{v}(t) = <1, y'(t)> . The area A swept by the particle's velocity vector from t=0 to t=1, projected onto the xy-plane, is formally defined by the integral A = \int_{0}^{1} ||\textbf{v}(t)|| dt. However, due to singularities in the velocity vector at t=0, a modified approach is required.  We instead consider the area between the curve defined by y(t) and the line y=x from t = 0 to t = 1.  A correction is introduced to account for the behavior near t=0. The corrected area is given by the integral representing the area between the curve y(t) and the line y = x, where the correction is expressed as the area under a curve that smoothly interpolates the difference between y(t) and x. This correction term is given by \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{\frac{x^4}{4} - x + 1 - \frac{1}{2x}} dx.
